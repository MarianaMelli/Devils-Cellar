Devil's Cellar was conceived with the purpose of integrating and applying comprehensively all the knowledge acquired during Hack Academy Web Development Bootcamp.

It's an E-commerce specialized in the marketing of wines, resulting from three intense weekly sprints and a combined dedication of 200 hours by a team of four people.
This project is based on the use of technologies such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB database, ODM (Mongoose), React.js, Redux, among others.

Among the functionalities are:
• User authentication: the ability to log in, create, and edit personal accounts.
• Extensive display of the product catalog, allowing exploration by specific categories.
• Shopping cart with complete functionalities to manage acquisitions.
• Comprehensive system for creating and tracking purchase orders.

It also has an administration panel that provides administrators with the necessary tools to efficiently manage the site. From this panel, it is possible to:
• Log in securely as an administrator.
• Create new administrator profiles.
• Manage and keep the inventory up to date, allowing the creation, editing, and deletion of products and categories.
• View and manage the user base, allowing deletion if necessary.
• Monitor and update the status of purchase orders for thorough control.
